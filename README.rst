Beanstalk deployment configuration for nginx as a proxy server for Amazon Elastic Search Service
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of June 2016, AWS Elastic Search Service doesn't support VPC, so to protect the ES instance, you have to use either
proxy, or request signing with SDK. Request signing might be an issue because of legacy code.
So this repository helps to set up a proxy in a couple of minutes with elasticbeanstalk.

Deployment
----------

You need to set up a security group named `elasticsearch-proxy-consumer` which doesn't need to have any rules, but will
be a marker for instances which need access to the elasticsearch proxy (whithin the same VPC).

You will need to install and configure elastic beanstalk `CLI <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html>`_


If it's a first time deployment with this clone, initialize an environment:

::

    make init AWS_PROFILE=<your aws profile> EB_APP_NAME=<your application name>

It's as easy as:

::

    make deploy AWS_PROFILE=<your aws profile> EB_ENVIRONMENT=<your elastic beanstalk environment>

You will need to create and configure elastic beanstalk environment prior to the deployment command.

Configuration
-------------

You will need to set up such environment variables for your elastic beanstalk environment:

* DEVELOPMENT_SERVICE
    your development elastic search endpoint, in form of ``endpoint.domain:443``
* STAGING_SERVICE
    your staging elastic search endpoint, in form of ``endpoint.domain:443``
* PRODUCTION_SERVICE
    your staging elastic search endpoint, in form of ``endpoint.domain:443``
* DEVELOPMENT_NGINX_SERVER_NAME
    space separated list of accepted server names to restrict your development application to, in form of ``endpoint.domain``
* STAGING_NGINX_SERVER_NAME
    space separated list of accepted server names to restrict your staging application to, in form of ``endpoint.domain``
* PRODUCTION_NGINX_SERVER_NAME
    space separated list of accepted server names to restrict your staging application to, in form of ``endpoint.domain``

After setting up the variables and deploying the change, make sure you've assigned `elasticsearch-proxy-consumer`
security group to instances needing the access to elastic search proxy.
